Conclusions  
7.1. Introduction 
Known for its influence to the performance of turbomachines, the tip leakage 
vortex is a dominating feature of the flow field near the rotor blade tip region. In 
compressors or shrouded marine propulsors where the rotor blade tip is restricted in a 
confined space, the flow in the endwall viscous region forms a vortex-like structure that 
convects downstream. This structure and its unsteadiness due to the stator-rotor 
interaction are sources of efficiency loss...

Conclusion  
 
 
The aerosolized experiments within the bio chamber and the walk-in refrigerator 
unit correlated well with one another. Both experiments exhibited the potential for 
Listeria species to containment the air as well as industrial surfaces under various 
conditions.  The environmental factors of humidity, temperature, distance from the 
source, and contact time played a significant role in the recovery of the bacteria from 
the tested surfaces and air samples.  In general com...

DISCUSSION
Tectonics
Ettensohn (1994) has suggested that the region was tectonically quiescent during deposition
of the study interval, and in a state of elevational equilibrium between the filled foreland basin and
the beveled Devonian orogenic highlands. Using the model of Quinlan and Beaumont (1984) and
Beaumont et al. (1988), Ettensohn (1994) provided a flexural tectonic model for the Mississippian
rocks of the Appalachian Basin.  Widespread deepening followed by progradation of Early
Mis...

data, implying that PM and vigilance may predict efficacy levels for the same tasks and that 
measurement items may, in fact, be contaminated with generalized self-efficacy. 
General Discussion 
Vigilance as an approach or an avoidance construct 
The vigilance construct was defined and measured in response to a potential construct 
deficiency in motivation research whereby effective aspects of the avoidance motive have mostly 
been ignored. The emergence of a vigilance construct suggests that...

such as creativity. Additional research will be required to clarify which motivational traits are the 
most powerful predictors of self-regulation and performance in various situations.  
Conclusions        
Psychometric evidence supports vigilance as a meaningful addition to the motivational 
traits framework. Evidence suggests that vigilance items capture unique information that is not 
assessed by existing motivational trait items. Additional evidence provided a minimum amount 
of support ...
